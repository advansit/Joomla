Adds all enabled J2Store / J2Commerce products to the OSMap sitemap automatically.

## Description

OSMap does not index J2Store or J2Commerce product pages out of the box.

This plugin bridges the gap: it registers with OSMap for `com_j2store` and
`com_j2commerce` menu items and emits one sitemap node per enabled product.
Two routing mechanisms are supported automatically:

- **J2Store** creates hidden menu items (`published=-2`) as children of the
  shop menu item, one per product. The plugin reads these items directly from
  `#__menu` and uses their `path` field as the sitemap URL — no URL generation
  needed.
- **J2Commerce 4+** uses standard menu items (`view=products`, `view=product`,
  `view=categories`). The plugin queries the products table and builds URLs via
  the component's own routing.

Products with `enabled=0` are excluded automatically. New or re-enabled
products are picked up on the next sitemap request.

## Features

- Adds all enabled J2Commerce products to the OSMap sitemap automatically
- Generates correct SEF URLs using J2Commerce's own routing mechanism
- Configurable priority and change frequency per product
- Excludes disabled products automatically
- Patches OSMap ≤ 5.1.3 `Factory::getTable()` bug on install/update

## Requirements

- [Joomla](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms) 5.x or 6.x
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- J2Commerce (formerly J2Store) 4.x or later
- [OSMap Free or Pro](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/osmap/) 5.x or later

> **OSMap ≤ 5.1.3 compatibility:** The installer script automatically patches a
> bug in OSMap ≤ 5.1.3 where `Factory::getTable()` returns `false` instead of
> `null`, causing a `TypeError` in PHP 8.1+. The patch is applied on install
> and update and is idempotent — OSMap ≥ 5.1.4 already contains the fix.

## Installation

1. Download `plg_osmap_j2commerce.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/advansit/Joomla/releases)
2. **System → Extensions → Install**
3. Upload and install
4. Enable via **System → Plugins → OSMap J2Commerce**
5. In OSMap (**Components → OSMap → Sitemaps**), ensure the menu containing
   your shop item is selected
6. Save the sitemap — products appear automatically

## Configuration

**System → Plugins → OSMap J2Commerce**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Priority | `0.8` | Sitemap priority for product pages |
| Change Frequency | `weekly` | How often search engines should re-crawl product pages |

OSMap's per-menu priority and change frequency settings take precedence over
the plugin defaults.

## How It Works

OSMap calls `getTree()` for every menu item whose `option` matches `com_j2store`
or `com_j2commerce`. The plugin tries two mechanisms in order:

### Mechanism 1 — J2Store hidden menu items (published=-2)

J2Store creates a hidden menu item (`published=-2`) for each product as a child
of the shop menu item. These items have:

- `link = index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=<article_id>`
- `path = shop/<product-alias>` (the SEF URL, already resolved)

The plugin queries `#__menu` for `published=-2` children of the current menu
item, joins `#__content` and `#__j2store_products` to verify the product is
enabled, and emits the menu item's `path` directly as the sitemap URL. No URL
generation is needed — the path is the canonical SEF URL as Joomla stored it.

This is the mechanism used by advans.ch and most J2Store installations.

### Mechanism 2 — J2Commerce 4+ view-based menu items

If no `published=-2` children are found, the plugin falls back to inspecting
the menu item's `view` parameter:

- `view=products` — all enabled products in the given category (`catid`), or all products if no `catid`
- `view=product` — the single product referenced by `id`
- `view=categories` — all enabled products across all categories

Product URLs are built as non-SEF `index.php?option=...` URLs; OSMap applies
SEF routing if configured.

## .htaccess Requirements

This plugin generates SEF URLs of the form `/de/shop/product-alias`. For these
to resolve correctly, your `.htaccess` must route all non-file requests through
Joomla's `index.php` (standard Joomla SEF setup):

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index\.php
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule .* index.php [L]
```

If your site blocks direct `com_content` or `component/` URLs (recommended for
SEO and security), ensure `/component/j2store` is explicitly allowed, as
J2Commerce uses it internally for cart and checkout:

```apache
# Block /component/ URLs except j2store (cart/checkout) and ajax
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(/[a-z]{2})?/component/ [NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^(/[a-z]{2})?/component/j2store [NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^(/[a-z]{2})?/component/ajax [NC]
RewriteRule ^([a-z]{2})?/?component/.*$ /$1/ [R=301,L]

# Block index.php?option=com_... except j2store and required components
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^option=com_ [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !^option=com_j2store [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !^option=com_ajax [NC]
RewriteRule ^([a-z]{2})?/?index\.php$ /$1/? [R=301,L]
```

Product pages (`/de/shop/product-alias`) are served entirely through Joomla's
SEF routing and do not require any additional rewrite rules.

```

## Automated Testing

This plugin has automated tests that run on every push via GitHub Actions.

### Test Suites

1. **Installation** — Plugin registration in DB, file deployment
2. **Configuration** — Plugin params, language files, XML manifest
3. **Plugin Class** — OSMap interface, `getTree()` method, class loading
4. **Sitemap Output** — Direct DB query test for `getTree()` result
5. **Uninstall** — Clean removal from database and filesystem
6. **Sitemap HTTP** — Full-stack HTTP request against the live sitemap endpoint

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
cd tests
docker compose up -d
sleep 120  # Wait for Joomla initialization
./run-tests.sh all
docker compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

**Products do not appear in the sitemap**

- Verify the plugin is enabled (**System → Plugins → OSMap J2Commerce**)
- Confirm the menu containing your shop item is selected in the OSMap sitemap
  configuration (**Components → OSMap → Sitemaps → edit → Menus tab**)
- Check that the product has `enabled=1` in J2Commerce/J2Store
  (**Components → J2Commerce → Products**)
- **J2Store:** Verify that each product has a hidden menu item (`published=-2`)
  as a child of the shop menu item in `#__menu`. J2Store creates these
  automatically when a product is saved.
- **J2Commerce 4+:** Verify that your shop menu item uses `view=products`,
  `view=product`, or `view=categories`.

**Only some products appear**

Products with `enabled=0` are intentionally excluded. Check the product status
in J2Commerce/J2Store.

For J2Store: a product also requires a `published=-2` menu item. If a product
was added without saving the menu item (e.g. via import), run J2Store's
"Rebuild Menu Items" function.

**SEF URLs are not resolved correctly**

Ensure Joomla's SEF is enabled (**System → Global Configuration → SEO Settings**)
and that the `.htaccess` / `web.config` rewrite rules are in place.

**TypeError: Factory::getTable() must be of type ?Table, false returned**

This is a bug in OSMap ≤ 5.1.3. The installer script patches it automatically
on plugin install or update. If you see this error before installing the plugin,
apply the fix manually:

```bash
sed -i 's/return Table::getInstance($tableName, $prefix);/return Table::getInstance($tableName, $prefix) ?: null;/' \
    /path/to/joomla/administrator/components/com_osmap/library/Alledia/OSMap/Factory.php
```

**Product URLs in the sitemap return 404**

Verify that:
1. Joomla's SEF is enabled and `.htaccess` routes non-file requests to `index.php`
2. `/component/j2store` is not blocked in `.htaccess` (J2Store needs it for cart/checkout)
3. **J2Store:** The `path` field of the `published=-2` menu item matches the
   expected SEF URL. If paths are wrong, rebuild the menu tree in Joomla
   (**System → Maintenance → Rebuild**).
4. **J2Commerce 4+:** The shop menu item uses `view=products`, `view=product`,
   or `view=categories` and the product has `enabled=1`.

See the [.htaccess Requirements](#htaccess-requirements) section above.

**J2Store: products appear with wrong or outdated URLs**

The J2Store mechanism uses the `path` field of the `published=-2` menu item
directly as the sitemap URL. If product aliases were renamed or the menu tree
was modified without rebuilding, the stored paths may be stale. Run
**System → Maintenance → Rebuild** to regenerate all menu item paths.
