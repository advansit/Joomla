## Description

GDPR/DSGVO compliance solution for J2Commerce shops on Joomla 5 and 6. Integrates with Joomla's native Privacy Suite (`com_privacy`) to handle data export, deletion requests, and consent — specifically for J2Commerce order and customer data. Supports J2Commerce 4.x (`#__j2store_*` tables) and J2Commerce 6.x (`#__j2commerce_*` tables) via runtime detection.

### Compatibility Test Scope

The CI installs Joomla full packages plus real J2Commerce/J2Store runtimes for the core privacy export, anonymization, cart cleanup, retention, and uninstall paths. The bundled checkout and MyProfile template overrides are now also **rendered** for both stacks (`com_j2store` on J5/J2Store 4 and `com_j2commerce` on J6/J2Commerce 6) and asserted to actually emit the consent checkbox and Privacy tab markup, reading the real installed-and-enabled plugin params. Optional AcyMailing paths are exercised against a minimal database fixture only; they are not a full AcyMailing installation/runtime compatibility proof. Lifetime-license detection is covered through the J2Commerce metafield database path, but it does not replace an end-to-end license plugin runtime test.

## Features

- **Checkout Consent Checkbox** — Privacy consent during checkout via template override
- **Privacy Policy Link** — Configurable link to privacy policy article
- **Address Management** — Frontend delete buttons for saved addresses
- **Automated Data Cleanup** — Scheduled anonymization after configurable retention period
- **MyProfile Privacy Tab** — User-facing privacy management in J2Commerce profile
- **Admin Notifications** — Email alerts on privacy-related user actions
- **Activity Logging** — Audit trail for all privacy operations
- **Legal Compliance** — Swiss OR Art. 958f / MWSTG Art. 70 compliant retention

## Requirements

- Joomla 5.0 or higher (Joomla 6 supported)
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- J2Commerce 4.0 or higher (J2Commerce 6 supported)
- Joomla Privacy Component enabled (`com_privacy`)

---

## Installation

### Scope and Limitations

**Supported Product Types:**
- One-time purchases with standard retention periods
- Perpetual software licenses with extended data retention

**Current Limitations:**

This version does not include automated handling of recurring subscription products. Subscription-based products require:
- Real-time payment gateway integration for subscription status verification
- Complex state management for active, paused, and cancelled subscriptions
- Renewal cycle tracking and grace period handling

Organizations with subscription-based business models should contact Advans IT Solutions for custom implementation requirements.

**Recommended Approach for Subscriptions:**
- Apply standard accounting retention periods to all subscription orders
- Implement manual review processes for active subscription accounts
- Maintain separate documentation of subscription-specific data retention policies

### Install Steps

1. Download `plg_privacy_j2commerce.zip`
2. **System → Extensions → Install**
3. Upload and install
4. **Enable via System → Plugins → System - J2Commerce Privacy**

### Post-Installation Configuration

The plugin requires mandatory configuration before operation. A detailed setup wizard is displayed upon installation. The following steps must be completed:

1. Enable the plugin in Joomla's plugin manager
2. Configure retention periods and legal compliance parameters
3. **Verify template overrides** — deployed automatically on first install; check the postflight message for which files were copied or skipped (see [Template Integration](#template-integration))
4. **Create a hidden menu item for Privacy Requests** (see below)
5. Configure lifetime-license flags if your shop sells perpetual licenses (optional)
6. Establish automated cleanup scheduling with the bundled task plugin

Note: Failure to configure the lifetime-license flag for perpetual-license products can result in full anonymization after the retention period expires.

### Required: Privacy Request Menu Item

Joomla's `com_privacy` component requires a frontend menu item to generate valid SEF URLs. Without it, privacy request links in the user profile redirect to the home page.

**Create the menu item:**

1. Navigate to **Menus → Main Menu → New**
2. Set **Menu Item Type** to **Privacy → Create Request**
3. Set **Title** to e.g. "Datenschutzanfrage" / "Privacy Request"
4. Set **Access** to **Registered**
5. Set **Status** to **Published**
6. Under **Link Type**, set **Display in Menu** to **No** (hidden menu item)
7. Save

This menu item is required for the "Data Export" and "Data Deletion" buttons in the J2Commerce profile privacy tab to work for logged-in users. Guest users see mailto links instead (see below).

---

## Joomla Privacy Framework

This plugin is a **privacy group plugin** that extends Joomla's built-in Privacy Suite (`com_privacy`). It does not replace or duplicate the core privacy system — it adds J2Commerce-specific data handling on top of it.

**What Joomla's Privacy Suite provides (core):**
- Privacy request management UI (`Users → Privacy → Requests`)
- Export and deletion request workflow
- Consent tracking (`#__privacy_consents`)
- Action logging (`#__action_logs`)
- Scheduled task infrastructure

**What this plugin adds:**
- J2Commerce order, address, and cart data in exports (`onPrivacyExportRequest`)
- Retention period enforcement before deletion (`onPrivacyCanRemoveData`)
- Order anonymization with configurable retention (`onPrivacyRemoveData`)
- Lifetime license detection to preserve email after retention expires
- Checkout consent checkbox
- Self-service privacy tab in the J2Commerce MyProfile page
- Scheduled automatic cleanup task

For a full overview of how Joomla's Privacy Suite works, see the [Joomla Privacy Suite Guide](https://docs.joomla.org/Privacy_Suite_Guide).

---

## Checkout and Profile Behavior

### Checkout Consent Checkbox

The plugin adds a privacy consent checkbox to the J2Commerce checkout (step 4: Shipping & Payment) via the template override `default_shipping_payment.php`. See [Template Integration](#template-integration) for deployment details.

**Validation:** Client-side JavaScript validates both the AGB/TOS checkbox (J2Store built-in) and the privacy consent checkbox together. If either is unchecked, both error messages are shown simultaneously. The validation uses capturing-phase event listeners that run before J2Store's jQuery handler.

**Error containers** use class `j2-validation-error` (not `j2error`) so that J2Store's global `$('.j2error').remove()` in the AJAX success handler does not destroy them.

### Consent Recording

| User Type | When | Where | Identifier |
|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| Logged-in | Checkout confirm step | `#__privacy_consents` | `user_id` |
| Guest | First profile view after checkout | `#__privacy_consents` | `user_id=0`, email in `body` field |

**Logged-in users:** Consent is written to `#__privacy_consents` when the user reaches the checkout confirm step (step 5). The plugin params are read directly from `#__extensions` because the privacy plugin group is not imported during checkout AJAX requests.

**Guest users:** At checkout, `Factory::getApplication()->getIdentity()` returns `user_id=0`. The consent entry is created retroactively when the guest views the profile privacy tab (accessed via order token). The guest email is read from the J2Store session (`guest_order_email`), and orders are matched by email address.

### Profile Privacy Tab

The privacy tab in J2Commerce's "My Profile" shows consent status and privacy request buttons.

> **Template override required.** The privacy tab is only rendered when the MyProfile template override (`default.php`) is in place. The override is deployed automatically on first install. See [Template Integration](#template-integration) for details.

**Consent status lookup** checks three sources in order:
1. `#__privacy_consents` table (by `user_id` for logged-in, not available for guests)
2. `#__j2store_orders` / `#__j2commerce_orders` by `user_id` (logged-in users)
3. `#__j2store_orders` / `#__j2commerce_orders` by `user_email` (guest users)

If an order is found but no `#__privacy_consents` entry exists, one is auto-created.

**Privacy request buttons** (Data Export, Data Deletion):

| User Type | Button Behavior |
|-----------|----------------|
| Logged-in | Links to `com_privacy` request form (requires menu item, see above) |
| Guest | `mailto:` link to site admin email (guests cannot use `com_privacy` — Joomla's Dispatcher redirects them to login) |

---

## Template Integration

This plugin is a **native Joomla privacy plugin**, not a J2Commerce plugin. It is registered under Joomla's `privacy` plugin group, which is what allows it to participate in Joomla's built-in Privacy Suite (`com_privacy`): handling data export requests, deletion requests, consent tracking, and the scheduled cleanup task.

The trade-off is that J2Commerce does not know about it. J2Commerce's `eventWithHtml()` — the mechanism J2Commerce uses to let plugins inject content into its views — only loads plugins from its own `j2store` group. Plugins in the `privacy` group are invisible to it. This means there is no event hook available inside J2Commerce's checkout or MyProfile views that this plugin can use.

Template overrides are the solution: by placing PHP files in `templates/{active-template}/html/com_j2store/` (J2Commerce 4.x) or `templates/{active-template}/html/com_j2commerce/` (J2Commerce 6.x), the overrides run as part of J2Commerce's own rendering and can check for this plugin via `PluginHelper` to conditionally add the consent checkbox and Privacy tab.

### Automatic deployment on first install

On first install, `script.php` copies the bundled overrides into every active frontend template.

**J2Commerce 4.x** (`com_j2store`):
```
templates/{template}/html/com_j2store/checkout/default_shipping_payment.php
templates/{template}/html/com_j2store/myprofile/default.php
templates/{template}/html/com_j2store/myprofile/default_addresses.php
```

**J2Commerce 6.x** (`com_j2commerce`):
```
templates/{template}/html/com_j2commerce/checkout/default_shipping_payment.php
templates/{template}/html/com_j2commerce/myprofile/default.php
templates/{template}/html/com_j2commerce/myprofile/default_addresses.php
```

Rules:
- Files are **only copied if they do not already exist** — existing customisations are never overwritten.
- On **updates**, no files are copied. Manage overrides manually after updating.
- The postflight message lists which files were copied and which were skipped.

### Manual deployment

If the automatic copy was skipped (file already existed, or you are installing on a non-standard template path), copy the source files manually:

```
# Source (inside the installed plugin)
JPATH_PLUGINS/privacy/j2commerce/overrides/com_j2store/      # J2Commerce 4.x
JPATH_PLUGINS/privacy/j2commerce/overrides/com_j2commerce/   # J2Commerce 6.x

# Destination (repeat for each active template)
templates/{your-template}/html/com_j2store/      # J2Commerce 4.x
templates/{your-template}/html/com_j2commerce/   # J2Commerce 6.x
```

### Requirements

- Joomla template based on **Bootstrap 5** (`default.php` uses BS5 tab markup)
- J2Commerce MyProfile view enabled

---

## AcyMailing Integration

This plugin includes optional AcyMailing support for both the **Privacy Suite** (data export and deletion) and the **MyProfile Newsletter tab** (subscription management).

### How it works

The integration uses **direct DB queries** against AcyMailing's tables — no AcyMailing PHP classes, helper files, or `acym_get()` are loaded. This means:

- Works with all AcyMailing versions: 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x, 10.x
- Works with all license tiers: Starter, Essential, Enterprise
- Works whether AcyMailing is enabled or disabled in Joomla
- Gracefully skipped when AcyMailing is not installed — no errors, no impact on existing behaviour

The plugin detects AcyMailing by scanning the database for a table ending in `acym_configuration`. If not found, all AcyMailing code paths are bypassed.

### Privacy Suite: what is exported and deleted

**Export (`onPrivacyExportRequest`):**

A `newsletter_subscriptions` domain is added to the export containing:

| Field | Source table | Description |
|---|---|---|
| email | `acym_user` | Subscriber e-mail address |
| name | `acym_user` | Subscriber name |
| confirmed | `acym_user` | Whether the subscriber confirmed their opt-in |
| created | `acym_user` | Subscription creation date |
| list / status / dates | `acym_user_has_list` | List name, subscribed/unsubscribed, subscription and unsubscribe dates |
| field / value | `acym_user_has_field` | Custom field values (name, address, phone, etc.) |
| campaign / send_date / opened / bounce / device | `acym_user_stat` | Per-campaign delivery and engagement stats |
| campaign / url / clicks / last_click | `acym_url_click` + `acym_url` | URL click tracking per campaign |
| date / ip / action / unsubscribe_reason | `acym_history` | Action log incl. IP address and unsubscribe reasons |

**Deletion (`onPrivacyRemoveData`):**

All rows referencing the subscriber are deleted before the subscriber record itself (foreign key order):

| Table | Data removed |
|---|---|
| `acym_user_has_list` | List subscriptions |
| `acym_user_has_field` | Custom field values (name, address, phone, etc.) |
| `acym_user_stat` | Per-campaign open/click/bounce/device stats |
| `acym_url_click` | URL click tracking |
| `acym_history` | Action log incl. IP address |
| `acym_queue` | Pending outbound emails |
| `acym_user` | Subscriber record (email, name, confirmation status) |

### MyProfile Newsletter tab

The Newsletter tab in J2Commerce MyProfile (`default_newsletter.php`) lets logged-in users manage their subscriptions directly — no redirect to a separate AcyMailing frontend page.

**To enable the Newsletter tab:**

1. Install AcyMailing (any version, any license tier) on the Joomla site.
2. Ensure the template override `templates/{template}/html/com_j2store/myprofile/default_newsletter.php` exists. This file is maintained in the `advansit/advans.ch` repository under `src/template/html/com_j2store/myprofile/default_newsletter.php`.
3. Ensure `default.php` includes the Newsletter tab block (already present in the advans.ch template override).
4. In AcyMailing, set the lists you want to expose to users: **AcyMailing → Lists → Edit → Visible: Yes**.

The tab is hidden automatically when AcyMailing is not installed — no configuration needed.

**What users can do in the Newsletter tab:**

- See all visible AcyMailing lists with their current subscription status
- Subscribe or unsubscribe per list via checkboxes
- Unsubscribe from all lists at once (with confirmation dialog)

**Tables accessed by `default_newsletter.php`:**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `{prefix}acym_configuration` | Presence check only (to detect AcyMailing) |
| `{prefix}acym_user` | Read/create subscriber record |
| `{prefix}acym_user_has_list` | Read/write subscription status per list |
| `{prefix}acym_list` | Read visible list names and descriptions |

No AcyMailing PHP classes are loaded. All queries use Joomla's `DatabaseDriver` API.

### How `default.php` activates the privacy tab

`default.php` checks for the plugin at runtime:

```php
$privacyPlugin = PluginHelper::getPlugin('privacy', 'j2commerce');
if ($privacyPlugin) {
    $privacyParams = new \Joomla\Registry\Registry($privacyPlugin->params);
    $showPrivacyTab = (bool) $privacyParams->get('show_privacy_section', 1);
    Factory::getLanguage()->load('plg_privacy_j2commerce', JPATH_PLUGINS . '/privacy/j2commerce');
}
```

If the plugin is not installed or disabled, `$showPrivacyTab` stays `false` and the tab is not rendered — no errors.

### Language file must be loaded manually

Because this is a native Joomla privacy plugin and not a J2Commerce plugin, Joomla does not auto-import it in the frontend. Its language file is therefore not loaded automatically either. Without the explicit `Factory::getLanguage()->load(...)` call in `default.php`, all `PLG_PRIVACY_J2COMMERCE_*` keys render as raw strings in the tab. This call is already included in the provided `default.php` — do not remove it.

### Updating overrides after plugin updates

When the plugin is updated, the override files in `JPATH_PLUGINS/privacy/j2commerce/overrides/` are updated but the deployed copies in `templates/` are **not** touched. After a plugin update:

1. Compare your deployed override with the new source file.
2. Merge any changes relevant to your customisation.
3. The postflight message on update will remind you of this.

### Licenses tab (optional)

`default.php` also conditionally renders a **Licenses** tab if the `#__license_keys` table exists and contains rows for the current user. This tab is unrelated to the privacy plugin — it is part of the Advans IT Solutions licensing system. If you do not use that system, the tab simply does not appear (the query is wrapped in a `try/catch`).

---

## Implementation Guide

### Estimated Implementation Time: 20-30 minutes

### Step 1: Configure Lifetime-License Flags (Optional)

This step is only required if your shop sells products with perpetual (lifetime) licenses. The plugin functions fully without it — lifetime license detection is simply skipped.

**Two separate tables are involved:**

| Table | Purpose | How to populate |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `#__j2commerce_metafields` (J2Commerce 6.x) | Marks which products are lifetime licenses | Insert product metafields with `owner_resource = product`, `metakey = is_lifetime_license`, `metavalue = yes` |
| `#__j2store_product_customfields` (J2Commerce 4.x) | Marks which products are lifetime licenses | Optional custom field table used by this plugin |
| `#__license_keys` | Stores issued license keys per user | Separate SQL — see Post-Install Message |

For J2Commerce 6, insert the metafield row shown in the post-installation message for every perpetual-license product. For J2Commerce 4 / J2Store, create and populate `#__j2store_product_customfields` as shown in the post-installation message.

> **Note:** The `#__license_keys` table, if present, belongs to the Advans licensing system and is not used by the cleanup task for lifetime-license detection.

---

### Step 2: Product Classification

For each product requiring perpetual license handling:

1. Find the product ID in J2Commerce / J2Store.
2. Insert the appropriate lifetime-license flag for your J2Commerce version.
3. Verify the stored value is `yes` or `Yes`; the cleanup query compares case-insensitively.

Repeat this process for all products requiring perpetual license data retention.

---

### Step 3: Plugin Activation

1. Navigate to: `System → Plugins`
2. Locate: `Privacy - J2Commerce`
3. Change status from Disabled to Enabled

---

### Step 4: Configure Retention Parameters

Navigate to: `System → Plugins → Privacy - J2Commerce`

#### Data Handling Configuration

- **Include Joomla Core Data:** Enable to include Joomla user account data in privacy exports
- **Anonymize Orders:** Enable to anonymize rather than delete order records (recommended for accounting compliance)
- **Delete Addresses:** Enable to remove stored address data upon data removal requests

#### Retention Settings

**Retention Period (Years):**
- Switzerland: `10`
- Germany: `10`
- Austria: `7`
- France: `10`
- Spain: `6`
- UK: `6`
- USA: `7`

**Legal Basis:** (Example for Switzerland)
```
• Switzerland: OR Art. 958f (10 years)
```

See [Legal Basis Examples](#legal-basis-examples) for more countries.

**Support Email:**
```
privacy@example.com
```

⚠️ **Important:** Replace this with your actual privacy contact email. This address is shown to users in all retention messages.

**Where to change:**
- `System → Plugins → Privacy - J2Commerce`
- Field: "Support Email"
- Example: `privacy@your-company.com`

Persist configuration changes.

---

### Step 5: Automated Cleanup Scheduling

Navigate to: `System → Scheduled Tasks → New`

1. Verify the plugin **Task - J2Commerce Privacy Cleanup** is enabled.
2. Select task type: **J2Commerce - Automatic data cleanup**
3. Configure task parameters to match the Privacy plugin retention settings.
4. Configure execution parameters:
   - **Execution Frequency:** Daily
   - **Execution Time:** 02:00 (recommended for minimal system load)
   - **Status:** Enabled
5. Save configuration

---

### Implementation Verification

Validate the implementation using the following test procedure:

1. Create a test product with lifetime-license flag `is_lifetime_license = yes`
2. Generate a test order for the configured product
3. Initiate a data removal request via `Users → Privacy → Requests → New Request`
4. Attempt data deletion via `Complete Request → Delete Data`
5. **Expected Result:** System blocks deletion and displays retention notification

Successful display of the retention notification confirms correct implementation.

---

## Features Overview

### Core Capabilities

- **Regulatory Compliance Export:** XML-formatted data exports compliant with GDPR Article 15 (Right of Access)
- **Automated Data Lifecycle Management:** Scheduled anonymization upon retention period expiration
- **Perpetual License Handling:** Selective data retention for software license reactivation requirements
- **Flexible Retention Frameworks:** Configurable retention periods (1-30 years) supporting multiple jurisdictions
- **Multi-Jurisdictional Support:** Configurable legal basis documentation for international operations
- **Automated Compliance Processing:** Scheduled task execution for expired data handling
- **Internationalization:** Multi-language interface support (German de-DE, English en-GB, French fr-FR)
- **Platform Integration:** Optional Joomla core user data inclusion in privacy exports

### Limitations

- **Recurring Subscriptions:** Automated subscription lifecycle management not included in current version
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Real-time subscription status verification requires custom implementation
- **Subscription State Management:** Active subscription handling requires manual administrative processes

### Data Handling

**What gets exported:**
- J2Store orders and order items
- Billing and shipping addresses
- Joomla user account (optional)
- User profile data (optional)
- Activity logs (optional)

**Payment Data Notice:**
Payment data (credit card details, bank information) is stored by payment service providers (Stripe, PayPal, etc.), not by this system. For payment data inquiries, users must contact the respective payment provider directly.

**What gets anonymized (only for orders OUTSIDE retention period):**
- Email address → `anonymized@deleted.invalid`
- Billing first/last name → `Anonymized` / `User`
- Shipping first/last name → (cleared)
- Phone → (cleared)
- Addresses → (cleared)
- Customer note → (cleared)
- IP address → (cleared)

**What stays intact (for orders WITHIN retention period):**
- Complete order data including addresses
- Required by Swiss law: OR Art. 958f, MWSTG Art. 70 (10 years)

**What stays (anonymized orders):**
- Order numbers
- Order dates
- Order amounts
- Product information

**Exception for Lifetime Licenses:**
- Email address preserved (for license activation)
- All other data anonymized

---

## How It Works

### User Workflow

```
1. User requests data deletion
   ↓
2. System checks: Has orders within retention period?
   ↓
3a. NO → Immediate deletion/anonymization
3b. YES → Deletion blocked, show retention message
   ↓
4. After retention period expires
   ↓
5. Scheduled task automatically anonymizes data
   ↓
6. Exception: Lifetime licenses keep email for activation
```

### Retention Logic

**For ALL orders:**
- Retention period: Configurable (default 10 years)
- Applies to: ALL orders, not just licenses
- Legal basis: Accounting requirements (e.g., Swiss OR Art. 958f)

**For Lifetime Licenses:**
- After accounting retention expires (10 years)
- Partial anonymization: Keep email, delete everything else
- Reason: License activation requires email
- Legal basis: GDPR Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b (Contract fulfillment)

### Automatic Cleanup

**Scheduled Task runs daily:**
1. Finds users with all orders older than retention period
2. Checks for lifetime licenses
3. Full anonymization: No lifetime licenses
4. Partial anonymization: Has lifetime licenses (keep email)
5. Logs all actions

---

## Lifetime License Detection

### How It Works

**Detection Method:** Version-specific product metadata

The plugin and bundled task check `is_lifetime_license` for each product:

```sql
-- J2Commerce 4.x
SELECT field_value 
FROM #__j2store_product_customfields 
WHERE product_id = ? 
AND field_name = 'is_lifetime_license'

-- J2Commerce 6.x
SELECT metavalue
FROM #__j2commerce_metafields
WHERE owner_resource = 'product'
AND owner_id = ?
AND metakey = 'is_lifetime_license'
```

**Result:**
- `metavalue` / `field_value` = `yes` → Lifetime License
- missing or any other value → Regular Product

### Technical Implementation Rationale

**Previous Implementation (Deprecated):** Heuristic keyword detection in product metadata
- Unreliable due to typographical variations
- Lacked explicit configuration control
- Language-dependent pattern matching
- Prone to false positive classifications

**Current Implementation:** Structured product metadata
- Explicit boolean classification per product
- Eliminates ambiguity in product type determination
- Language-agnostic implementation
- Provides clear administrative visibility

### Product Type Support Matrix

**Supported:**
- One-time purchase transactions with standard retention
- Perpetual software licenses with extended retention

**Not Supported:**
- Recurring subscription products with active lifecycle management
- Real-time subscription status verification

**Note:** Organizations requiring subscription handling should implement manual review processes or contact Advans IT Solutions for custom development.

### Configuration

**For each Lifetime License product:**

1. Open product in J2Store
2. Find "Custom Fields" section
3. Set "Lifetime License" to "Yes"
4. Save

**That's it!** No code changes, no database modifications needed.

## Usage Guide

### Data Export

The export request flow is handled by Joomla's core Privacy component. See the [Joomla Privacy Suite Guide](https://docs.joomla.org/Privacy_Suite_Guide) for how users submit export requests and how administrators process them.

This plugin extends the export with J2Commerce-specific data: orders, order items, addresses, and (if configured) cart data.

---

### Data Deletion

#### Scenario 1: User without orders

**Result:** • Immediate deletion

```
User requests deletion
  ↓
No orders found
  ↓
Data immediately anonymized
```

---

#### Scenario 2: User with recent orders

**Result:** • Deletion blocked

```
User requests deletion
  ↓
Orders found (e.g., 3 years old)
  ↓
Retention: 10 years → 7 years remaining
  ↓
Deletion blocked with message
```

**Error Message:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DATA DELETION CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your data cannot be deleted at this time because you
have placed orders subject to a statutory retention
obligation.

YOUR ORDERS:
1. Order #123
   Date: 15.03.2020
   Amount: 99.00 CHF
   Retained until: 15.03.2030
   Remaining: 7.0 years

AUTOMATIC DELETION:
• Your data will be AUTOMATICALLY deleted from: 15.03.2030
• You do NOT need to take any further action
```

---

#### Scenario 3: User with old orders (retention expired)

**Result:** • Automatic deletion

```
Scheduled task runs daily (02:00)
  ↓
Finds users with orders older than 10 years
  ↓
Checks for lifetime licenses
  ↓
No lifetime licenses → Full anonymization
Has lifetime licenses → Partial anonymization (keep email)
```

---

#### Scenario 4: User with Lifetime License

**Result:** Partial anonymization

```
After 10 years:
  ↓
Accounting retention expired
  ↓
Has lifetime license
  ↓
Partial anonymization:
  • Email preserved (for license activation)
  • Name anonymized
  • Address deleted
  • Phone anonymized
```

**Error Message:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LIFETIME LICENSES (accounting retention expired)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IS RETAINED?

Required for license activation:
• Email address (for activation)
• License key
• Purchase date

Already deleted/anonymized:
• Full name
• Billing address
• Phone number
```

---

## Administrator Guide

### Where to See Retention Messages

**Location 1: Flash Message (Immediate)**
- Appears at top of screen after clicking "Delete Data"
- Red error message with full details
- Shows retention period, orders, automatic deletion date

**Location 2: Action Log (Permanent)**
- Visible in request detail view
- `Users → Privacy → Requests → [Click Request]`
- Under "Action Log" section

**Location 3: Request Status**
- Request remains in "Confirmed" status if blocked
- Changes to "Complete" when deletion succeeds

---

### Managing Requests

Request management (viewing, confirming, completing export and deletion requests) is handled by Joomla's core Privacy component. See the [Joomla Privacy Suite Guide](https://docs.joomla.org/Privacy_Suite_Guide) for the full workflow.

This plugin intercepts the deletion step to apply retention logic before any data is removed. If retention blocks deletion, the request stays in "Confirmed" status and the user receives a retention message.

## Lifetime License Metadata

### Why Explicit Metadata?

**The plugin uses explicit product metadata to detect Lifetime Licenses.**

**Advantages:**
- • No J2Store code modifications needed
- • Explicit configuration per product
- • No typos or false positives
- • Clear Yes/No choice
- • Visible in product overview

### Setup

**See [Quick Setup Guide](#quick-setup-guide) Step 1**

### Technical Details

**Database Table:** `#__j2commerce_metafields` (J2Commerce 6.x) / `#__j2store_product_customfields` (J2Commerce 4.x)

**Example Data (J2Commerce 6.x):**
```sql
INSERT INTO `#__j2commerce_metafields`
  (`owner_id`, `owner_resource`, `metakey`, `metavalue`)
VALUES
  (123, 'product', 'is_lifetime_license', 'yes');
```

**Structure (J2Commerce 4.x):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `#__j2store_product_customfields` (
  `j2store_customfield_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `product_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `field_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `field_value` text,
  PRIMARY KEY (`j2store_customfield_id`)
);
```

**Example Data (J2Commerce 4.x):**
```sql
INSERT INTO `#__j2store_product_customfields` VALUES
(1, 123, 'is_lifetime_license', 'Yes'),
(2, 456, 'is_lifetime_license', 'No');
```

**Query (J2Commerce 4.x):**
```sql
SELECT field_value
FROM #__j2store_product_customfields
WHERE product_id = 123
AND field_name = 'is_lifetime_license';
-- Result: 'Yes'
```

**Query (J2Commerce 6.x):**
```sql
SELECT metavalue
FROM #__j2commerce_metafields
WHERE owner_resource = 'product'
AND owner_id = 123
AND metakey = 'is_lifetime_license';
-- Result: 'yes'
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

Creates: `plg_privacy_j2commerce.zip`

## Automated Testing

This plugin has automated tests that run on every push and on pull requests via GitHub Actions.

### Test Suites

1. **Installation** — plugin registration in DB, file deployment, template overrides
2. **Configuration** — plugin params, language files, XML manifest
3. **Plugin Class** — method existence and class structure
4. **Data Export** — `onPrivacyExportRequest` output validation
5. **Data Integration** — test data setup and CRUD operations
6. **Data Anonymization** — `onPrivacyRemoveData` retention logic
7. **GDPR Compliance** — all DSGVO-relevant methods and hooks
8. **Template Overrides** — override source files and deployment verification
9. **Consent UI Render** — renders the deployed checkout and MyProfile overrides for the active stack (`com_j2store` / `com_j2commerce`) and asserts the real consent checkbox (`id`/`name="j2commerce_privacy_consent"`) and Privacy tab markup (`j2commerce-privacy-tab`, shield icon) actually appear in the produced HTML
10. **AutoCleanup Task** — scheduled task registration and execution
11. **AcyMailing Integration** — newsletter consent sync
12. **Uninstall** — clean removal from database and filesystem

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
cd tests
docker compose up -d
timeout 300 bash -c 'until docker exec plg_privacy_j2commerce_test test -f /var/www/html/health.txt 2>/dev/null; do sleep 5; done'
./run-tests.sh all
docker compose down -v

# Joomla 6
docker compose -f docker-compose.joomla6.yml up -d
timeout 300 bash -c 'until docker exec plg_privacy_j2commerce_j6_test test -f /var/www/html/health.txt 2>/dev/null; do sleep 5; done'
./run-tests.sh all
docker compose -f docker-compose.joomla6.yml down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Custom Field not visible**
- Check: Field is Published
- Check: Display in = Product
- Clear cache: System → Clear Cache

**Issue: Lifetime products not detected**
- Check: Field name is exactly `is_lifetime_license`
- Check: Field value is `Yes` (not `yes` or `1`)
- Check: Product saved after setting field

**Issue: Scheduled task not running**
- Check: Joomla Cron configured
- Test: Run task manually
- Check: Task logs for errors

**Issue: Subscription-based products**
- **Status:** Recurring subscription lifecycle management not included in current version
- **Recommended Approach:** Apply standard accounting retention periods to subscription orders
- **Enterprise Requirements:** Contact Advans IT Solutions for custom subscription handling implementation
