## Testing

Each extension has automated tests that run via GitHub Actions when files in the respective directory are modified.

| Workflow | Extension | Trigger |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `joomla-ajax-forms.yml` | Joomla AJAX Forms | `plg_ajax_joomlaajaxforms/**` |
| `j2commerce-import-export.yml` | Import/Export | `j2commerce/com_j2commerce_importexport/**` |
| `j2store-cleanup.yml` | J2Store Cleanup | `j2commerce/com_j2store_cleanup/**` |
| `j2commerce-product-compare.yml` | Product Compare | `j2commerce/plg_j2commerce_productcompare/**` |
| `j2commerce-privacy.yml` | Privacy | `j2commerce/plg_privacy_j2commerce/**` |

## Releases

Releases are created **manually** via the GitHub Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`). Each extension has its own release workflow, tag prefix and independent version.

### How to create a release

1. Go to **Actions** → select the release workflow for the extension
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Choose a bump level or leave empty for auto-detect from commits

Auto-detect uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since the last tag:

| Commit Prefix | Version Bump | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `fix:` | Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) | `fix: correct cart count query` |
| `feat:` | Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) | `feat: add product export filter` |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | `feat!: require Joomla 5+` |

Commits without a conventional prefix are ignored — no release is created.

### Release workflows

| Workflow | Tag Pattern |
|----------|-------------|
| `release-joomla-ajax-forms.yml` | `ajaxforms-v*` |
| `release-importexport.yml` | `importexport-v*` |
| `release-cleanup.yml` | `cleanup-v*` |
| `release-productcompare.yml` | `productcompare-v*` |
| `release-privacy.yml` | `privacy-v*` |

Each release workflow deletes the previous release and tag for the same extension before creating the new one. This ensures there is always exactly one release per extension.

## Repository Configuration

This repository is configured with the following GitHub settings for security, automation, and collaboration.

### Security Settings

All security features are configured at: **Settings → Security → Code security and analysis**

#### Private Vulnerability Reporting

**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository

Allows security researchers to privately report potential security vulnerabilities directly to repository maintainers. Reports are submitted via GitHub's security advisory system and remain private until disclosed.

#### Dependency Graph
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph

Automatically detects and displays all dependencies (Composer packages, GitHub Actions) used in this repository. Provides visibility into the software supply chain.

#### Dependabot Alerts
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts

Automatically notifies maintainers when dependencies have known security vulnerabilities. Alerts appear in the Security tab and via notifications.

#### Dependabot Security Updates
**Status:** ✅ Enabled (with grouped updates)  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates

Automatically creates pull requests to update dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. Grouped updates combine multiple security updates into a single pull request to reduce noise.

#### Dependabot Version Updates
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Configuration:** `.github/dependabot.yml`  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates

Automatically creates pull requests to keep dependencies up-to-date (not just security updates). Configured to check weekly for:
- Composer dependencies in plugin directories
- GitHub Actions workflows

#### Code Scanning (CodeQL)
**Status:** ✅ Enabled (default setup)  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning

Automatically analyzes code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors using GitHub's CodeQL engine. Runs on every push and pull request. Detects issues like SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

#### Copilot Autofix
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-autofix-for-codeql-code-scanning

Automatically suggests fixes for code scanning alerts using AI. Provides code suggestions to remediate security vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL.

#### Secret Scanning
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning

Scans the entire repository history for accidentally committed secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords). Alerts maintainers when secrets are detected.

#### Push Protection
**Status:** ✅ Enabled  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations

Prevents commits containing secrets from being pushed to the repository. Blocks the push and alerts the developer before secrets are committed.

### Access Control

#### Code Review Limits
**Status:** ✅ Enabled - Collaborators only  
**Location:** Settings → Moderation → Code review limits  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-pull-request-reviews-in-your-repository

Only users with write access (collaborators) can approve or request changes on pull requests. All users can still comment and create pull requests.

#### Branch Protection
**Branch:** `main`  
**Location:** Settings → Branches  
**Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches

Protected branch rules prevent force pushes and ensure code quality standards.

### Repository Features
